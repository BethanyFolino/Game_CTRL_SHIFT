## Description:

CTRL+SHiFT was inspired by the GameFAQs.com website but we streamlined it to solely focus on walkthrough demonstrations and interaction through comments on said walkthroughs. Users will have the ability to get information about specific games, ask questions, answer questions, receive notifications, create walkthrough tutorials and comment or like user input from their personal profile.
