Devloper: Marilynn Ramirez

## Description:

CTRL+SHiFT was inspired by the GameFAQs.com website but we streamlined it to solely focus on walkthrough demonstrations and interaction through comments on said walkthroughs. Users will have the ability to get information about specific games, ask questions, answer questions, receive notifications, create walkthrough tutorials and comment or like user input from their personal profile.

Our stretch goals included:

1. Users follow each and receive notifications for each
2. Messages sent to users from users (private messaging)
3. Forum for each genre so people can build a sense of community for those games.
4. Have our own game database

## Installation

To run this app the Poetry Project Manager Tool is needed. first do a -poetry install- in the command line to install all dependencies to have access to the manage.py commands. Then type -python manage.py runserver- to run the server. You can access and interact with the app in your local host.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, We got a whole lot more confortable building a full-stack web-app.
We learned that are many ways to get features to work such as the 'search bar' and its functionality. We are proud of our app because despite not having a game model we manage to connect the walkthrough, comments, questions and answers models.
